<p>Isaac Amundson is a research engineer in the Trusted Methods group at Collins Aerospace.  He has 18 years of academic and industry experience in safety-critical cyber-physical systems research and development across medical, high-voltage power, agriculture and off-road construction machinery, commercial vehicle and aerospace domains, and has first-hand knowledge of the challenges, roadblocks, and pitfalls involved in certifying products in these highly-regulated environments.</p>
<p>Dr. Amundson received MS degrees in Mechanical Engineering (2004) and Computer Science (2006), and his PhD in Computer Science (2010), all from Vanderbilt University.  In addition, he received Functional Safety engineer certification from T&#220;V Rheinland in 2017.</p>
<p>Dr. Amundson has a strong background in systems engineering best practices, including model-based development and formal methods, and has led the design and implementation of multiple model-based development tools and toolchains for providing inherent dependability in high-assurance systems.
He is currently participating on the DARPA CASE program (TAs 2 and 5), DARPA ARCOS (TA 3), and the DARPA Assured Autonomy program (TAs 1-3), in which he is exploring practical methods for generating and conveying assurance through the use of new and existing tools, including the Collins Aerospace AGREE and Resolute tools.</p>
