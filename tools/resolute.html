<p>
Resolute is a language and tool for developing architectural assurance
cases. A user specifies rules for constructing assurance cases and
provides an architectural model. Resolute instantiates those rules
based on the architectural model and searches for a complete assurance
case. The rules are specified in a Prolog-like logical language, and the
architectural model is specified in AADL.
