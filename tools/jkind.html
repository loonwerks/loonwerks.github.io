summary: An infinite-state model checker for safety properties

<p>
JKind is an infinite state model checker for verifying safety
properties of synchronous systems. Systems and their properties are
expressed in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(programming_language)">Lustre</a>
language. Verification is based on k-induction and property directed
reachability using a back-end SMT solver. A verified property is
guaranteed to be true for all runs of the system. A falsified property
is reported with an explicit counterexample demonstrating the property
violation.
</p>

<p>
JKind is used as the back-end model checker for many projects and
tools at Rockwell Collins
including <a href="/tools/agree.html">AGREE</a>, <a href="/tools/spear.html">SpeAR</a>,
and
<a href="https://github.com/lgwagner/SIMPAL">SIMPAL</a>. JKind is also
used for internal projects releated to test case generation and
certification.

<!--
<p>
JKind is cross-platform, reliable, and easy to extend. JKind is largely
compatible with the <a href="http://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/Kind/">KIND</a>
and <a href="http://kind2-mc.github.io/kind2/">Kind 2</a> model
checkers.
</p>
-->

<p>
JKind requires at least Java 8. JKind
uses <a href="http://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/smtinterpol/">SMTInterpol</a>
by default (packaged with JKind), but it also supports
<a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3</a>, 
<a href="http://yices.csl.sri.com/old/download-yices1.shtml">Yices 1</a>,
<a href="http://yices.csl.sri.com/">Yices 2</a>,
<a href="http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/">CVC4</a>,
and <a href="http://mathsat.fbk.eu/">MathSAT</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/agacek/jkind-xtext">JKind Xtext</a> is an
Eclipse plug-in with syntax highlighting and static analysis for
Lustre code. It also runs JKind and reports the results graphically.
</p>

<p>
JKind is primarily developed by <a href="/people/andrew-gacek.html">Andrew Gacek</a>.
