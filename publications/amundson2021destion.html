Resolute is a tool and language for embedding an assurance argument
in a system architecture model and evaluating the validity of
the associated evidence. In this paper we report on a number of extensions
to Resolute that support systems engineers in developing
safe and cyber-resilient systems. System requirements are imported
as assurance goals to be satisfied. Architectural transforms are applied
to the system model to address these requirements, while
corresponding assurance strategies and evidence are automatically
added to document how the requirements have been satisfied. Subsequent
changes to the model that invalidate any of the assurance
claims can be detected and corrected.We also use Resolute to check
that the model satisfies rules for code generation and other modeling
guidelines. We conclude with an application of the Resolute
assurance process to the design of a mission planning system for
an unmanned air vehicle.
