Model-based development tools are increasingly being
used for system-level development of safety-critical systems.
Architectural and behavioral models provide important information
that can be leveraged to improve the system safety
analysis process. Model-based design artifacts produced in early
stage development activities can be used to perform system
safety analysis, reducing costs, and providing accurate results
throughout the system life-cycle. In this paper we describe an
extension to the Architecture Analysis and Design Language
(AADL) that supports modeling of system behavior under
failure conditions. This Safety Annex enables the independent
modeling of component failures and allows safety engineers to
weave various types of fault behavior into the nominal system
model. The accompanying tool support uses model checking to
propagate errors from their source to their effect on top-level
safety properties without the need to add separate propagation
specifications. Our tools are also able to compute minimal cut
sets for these errors to produce faults trees familiar to safety
engineers and certification authorities. We describe the Safety
Annex, illustrate its use with a representative example, and
discuss and demonstrate the tool support enabling an analyst
to investigate the system behavior under failure conditions.
