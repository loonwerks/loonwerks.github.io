Aircraft systems that include learning-enabled components
(LECs) and their software implementations are not
amenable to verification and certification using current methods.
We have produced a demonstration of a run-time assurance architecture
based on a neural network aircraft taxiing application
that shows how several advanced technologies could be used to
ensure safe operation. In this paper we report
on the use of a run-time assurance architecture based on the
ASTM F3269-17 standard for bounded behavior of complex
systems, also known as a simplex architecture.  Our
implementation of the standard includes:
<ul>
<li>System architecture modeled using the Architecture Analysis
and Design Language (AADL)</li>
<li>Formal verification of system behaviors using the Assume
Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE)</li>
<li>Architecture-based assurance case for showing correct
implementation using Resolute</li>
<li>Diverse run-time monitors for system safety, integrity,
and availability</li>
<li>Synthesis from formal specifications with proof of correctness
for critical high-assurance components</li>
</ul>
