<p>Cyber-physical systems, such as avionics, must be
tolerant to cyber-attacks in the same way they are tolerant to
random faults: they either gracefully recover or safely shut down
as requirements dictate. The DARPA Cyber Assured Systems
Engineering program is developing tools for design, analysis,
and verification that enable systems engineers to design-in cyberresiliency
in a Model-Based Systems Engineering environment.
This paper describes automated model transformations that
introduce high-assurance cyber-resiliency components into a
system, in particular filters and monitors that prevent malicious
input and detect supply chain attacks, respectively. A
formal specification defines each high-assurance component, and
is used to verify that the component addresses system level
cyber requirements. Implementations for these high-assurance
components are directly synthesized from their specifications,
and are automatically proven to preserve the exact meaning of
the specifications all the way down to the binary code level.
The model transformations are integrated into the Open Source
AADL Tool Environment (OSATE). The paper further reports on
a case study applying security-enhancing model transformations
to a UAV system that uses the Air Force Research Laboratory’s
OpenUxAS services for route planning. In the case study, the
model transformations add filters to guard against malformed
input, as well as monitors to guard against ground station
spoofing and malicious flight plans from OpenUxAS.
