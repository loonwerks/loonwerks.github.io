There has been much publicity surrounding the use of machine learning technologies in self-driving cars and the challenges this presents for guaranteeing safety. 
These technologies are also being investigated for use in manned and unmanned aircraft.  However, systems that include "learning-enabled components" (LECs) 
and their software implementations are not amenable to verification and certification using current methods. 
We have produced a demonstration of a run-time assurance architecture based on a neural network aircraft taxiing application that shows how several 
advanced technologies could be used to ensure safe operation.  The demonstration system includes a safety architecture based on the ASTM F3269-17 
standard for bounded behavior of complex systems, diverse run-time monitors of system safety, and formal synthesis of critical high-assurance components.  
The enhanced system demonstrates the ability of the run-time assurance architecture to maintain system safety in the presence of defects in the underlying LEC.
