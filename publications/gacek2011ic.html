Recursive relational specifications are commonly used to describe the
computational structure of formal systems. Recent research in proof
theory has identified two features that facilitate direct, logic-based
reasoning about such descriptions: the interpretation of atomic
judgments through recursive definitions and an encoding of binding
constructs via generic judgments. However, logics encompassing these
two features do not currently allow for the definition of relations
that embody dynamic aspects related to binding, a capability needed in
many reasoning tasks. We propose a new relation between terms called
nominal abstraction as a means for overcoming this deficiency. We
incorporate nominal abstraction into a rich logic also including
definitions, generic quantification, induction, and co-induction that
we then prove to be consistent. We present examples to show that this
logic can provide elegant treatments of binding contexts that appear
in many proofs, such as those establishing properties of typing
calculi and of arbitrarily cascading substitutions that play a role in
reducibility arguments.
