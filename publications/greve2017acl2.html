We are implementing a procedure for generalizing SMT
counterexamples. In doing so we have developed a specification for
what it means for a generalization to be correct and a formalization
of our generalization algorithm. In proving that our algorithm
satisfies our specification, we uncovered a subtle and interesting
error in our generalization rules.
