Fuzz testing is a form of automated robustness testing that employs
random, invalid or unusual inputs to search for unknown and
potentially exploitable system behaviors. In this paper we describe
model-based fuzzing, a fuzzing technique that utilizes both a
mathematical model to guide the fuzzing process and a constraint
solver to deduce high-quality tests capable of targeting deep system
behaviors that random testing alone would be unlikely to reach.  We
describe the model-based fuzzing framework FuzzM, demonstrate how it
can be used to model a simple system, and compare its performance with
several off-the-self fuzing solutions.
