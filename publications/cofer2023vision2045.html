Advanced capabilities planned for the next generation of autonomous
and increasingly autonomous air vehicles will include non-traditional components
based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and complex
optimization and planning algorithms. These complex components will be
used to provide enhanced safety and high-level decision-making functions.
However, there are serious barriers to the deployment of autonomous
aircraft in the National Airspace System (NAS). Current civil aviation
certification processes are based on the concept that the correct behavior
of a system or a component must be completely specified and verified prior
to operation. This report from the Autonomy Verification and Validation
(V &amp V) Roadmap and Vision 2045 project presents the most recent effort to
build a comprehensive list of verification challenges and needs for autonomous
aircraft, a roadmap to meet those autonomy V &amp V needs, the
services they can enable, and point to the certification gaps they fill. To
accomplish these goals, we assembled a team of world-class researchers
from the aerospace industry (Boeing, Collins Aerospace, and General
Electric) and academia (University of Michigan, University of Texas, and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology) with deep expertise in autonomy,
aerospace systems, and assurance of Artificial Intelligence/machine learning
systems.
