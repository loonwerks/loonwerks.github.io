<p>
During the development and verification of complex airborne
systems, a variety of languages and development environments are used
for different levels of the system hierarchy. As a result, there may be
manual steps to translate requirements between these different environments.
This paper presents a tool-supported export technique that
translates high-level requirements from the software architecture modeling
environment into property observers that can be used for verification
in the software component environment. This allows efficient verification
that the component designs comply with their high-level requirements.
It also provides an automated tool chain supporting formal verification
from system requirements down to low-level software requirements that
is consistent with certification guidance for avionics systems. The effectiveness
of the technique has been evaluated and demonstrated on a
medical infusion pump and an aircraft wheel braking system.
