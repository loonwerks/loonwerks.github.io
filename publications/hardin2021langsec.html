<p>Safety- and security-critical developers have long
recognized the importance of applying a high degree of scrutiny
to a system's (or subsystem's) I/O messages. However, lack of
care in the development of message-handling components can
lead to an increase, rather than a decrease, in the attack surface.
On the DARPA Cyber-Assured Systems Engineering (CASE)
program, we have focused our research effort on identifying
cyber vulnerabilities early in system development, in particular
at the Architecture development phase, and then automatically
synthesizing components that mitigate against the identified
vulnerabilities from high-level specifications. This approach is
highly compatible with the goals of the LangSec community.
Advances in formal methods have allowed us to produce
hardware/software implementations that are both performant
and guaranteed correct. With these tools, we can synthesize
high-assurance "building blocks" that can be composed automatically
with high confidence to create trustworthy systems,
using a method we call Security-Enhancing Architectural Transformations.
Our synthesis-focused approach provides a higherleverage
insertion point for formal methods than is possible
with post facto analytic methods, as the formal methods tools
directly contribute to the implementation of the system, without
requiring developers to become formal methods experts.
Our techniques encompass Systems, Hardware, and Software
Development, as well as Hardware/Software Co-Design/Co-
Assurance. We illustrate our method and tools with an example
that implements security-improving transformations on system
architectures expressed using the Architecture Analysis and
Design Language (AADL). We show how message-handling
components can be synthesized from high-level regular or
context-free language specifications, as well as a novel specification
language for self-describing messages called Contiguity
Types, and verified to meet arithmetic constraints extracted
from the AADL model. Finally, we guarantee that the intent
of the message processing logic is accurately reflected in the
application binary code through the use of the verified CakeML
compiler, in the case of software, or the Restricted Algorithmic
C toolchain with ACL2-based formal verification, in the case
of hardware/software co-design.
