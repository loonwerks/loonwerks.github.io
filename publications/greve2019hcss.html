Constraint solving technology can be used to generate tests from
model-based system requirements.  Such tests can be generated
automatically and are capable of meeting even stringent MC/DC code
coverage criteria required for DO-178C Level A certification.  Given
that high-quality safety-relevant behavioral tests can be generated
from requirements-level models, perhaps a similar approach works for
security-relevant testing as well.  Fuzz testing is an example of
security-relevant testing that employs random, invalid or unusual
inputs to search for unknown and potentially exploitable system
behaviors.  In this talk we will discuss model-based grey-box fuzzing,
a fuzzing technique that employs mathematical models of system-level
requirements to guide the fuzzing process and constraint solving
technology to deduce high-quality tests capable of targeting deep
system behaviors that random fuzzing alone would be unlikely to reach.
The talk will provide an overview of model-based fuzzing, demonstrate
how it can be used to model a simple system, and compare its
performance with several more traditional off-the-self fuzzing
solutions.  We will also identify some on-going research challenges
associated with model-based fuzzing, including expressing and
targeting security relevant requirements and measuring the
effectiveness of the generated tests.
