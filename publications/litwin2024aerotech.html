In recent years, the increasing complexity of modern aerospace systems has driven the rapid adoption of robust Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). MBSE is a development methodology centered around computational models, which are instrumental in supporting the design and analysis of intricate systems. In this context, the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) and Systems Modeling Language (SysML) are two prominent modeling languages for specifying and analyzing the structure and behavior of a cyber-physical system. Both languages have their own specific use cases and tool environments and are typically employed to model different aspects of system design. Although multiple software tools are available for transforming models from one language to another, their effectiveness is limited by fundamental differences in the semantics of each language. The upcoming release of SysML Version 2 provides an opportunity to address these shortcomings thanks to several improvements that bring the two languages closer together. In this paper, we embark on an exploration of a transformation pathway between AADL and SysML v2, while identifying the existing gaps and challenges that persist. Furthermore, we provide recommendations to overcome these issues. Our approach's feasibility is demonstrated using an open-source AADL model employed in a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) research project as a case study. We also outline several transformation rules required for converting the AADL model into a syntactically correct and semantically equivalent SysML v2 model.
