<p>We introduce <em>Contiguity Types</em>, a formalism for network message formats, aimed especially at
self-describing formats. Contiguity types provide an intermediate layer between programming
language data structures and messages, offering a helpful setting from which to automatically
generate decoders, filters, and message generators. The syntax and semantics of contiguity types are
defined and used to prove the correctness of a matching algorithm which has the flavour of a parser
generator. The matcher has been used to enforce semantic well-formedness conditions on complex
message formats for an autonomous unmanned avionics system.
