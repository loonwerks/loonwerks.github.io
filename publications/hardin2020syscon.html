<p>Experienced developers of safety-critical and
security-critical systems have long emphasized the importance
of applying the highest degree of scrutiny to a system’s I/O
boundaries. From a safety perspective, input validation is a
traditional “best practice.” For security-critical architecture and
design, identification of the attack surface has emerged as a
primary analysis technique. One of our current research focus
areas concerns the identification of and mitigation against attacks
along that surface, using mathematically-based tools. We are
motivated in these efforts by emerging application areas, such
as assured autonomy, that feature a high degree of network connectivity,
require sophisticated algorithms and data structures,
are subject to stringent accreditation/certification, and encourage
hardware/software co-design approaches. We have conducted
several experiments employing a state-of-the-art toolchain, due
to Russinoff and O’Leary, and originally designed for use in
floating-point hardware verification, to determine its suitability
for the creation of safety-critical/security-critical input filters.
We focus first on software implementation, but extending to
hardware as well as hardware/software co-designs. We have
implemented a high-assurance filter for JSON-formatted data
used in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) application. Our
JSON filter is built using a table-driven lexer/parser, supported
by mathematically-proven lexer and parser table generation
technology, as well as verified data structures. Filter behavior is
expressed in a subset of Algorithmic C, which defines a set of C++
header files providing support for hardware design, including
the peculiar bit widths utilized in that discipline, and enables
compilation to both hardware and software platforms. The
Russinoff-O’Leary Restricted Algorithmic C (RAC) toolchain
translates Algorithmic C source to the Common Lisp subset
supported by the ACL2 theorem prover; once in ACL2, filter
behavior can be mathematically verified. We describe how we
utilize RAC to translate our JSON filter to ACL2, present
proofs of correctness for its associated data types, and describe
validation and performance results obtained through the use of
concrete test vectors.
