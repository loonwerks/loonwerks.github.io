<p>We describe a method and tools for the creation of
formally verified components that run on the verified
seL4 microkernel. This synthesis and verification
environment provides a basis to create safe and
secure critical systems. The mathematically proved
space and time separation properties of seL4 are
particularly well-suited for the miniaturised electronics
of smaller, lower-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),
as multiple, independent UAV applications can be
hosted on a single CPU with high assurance. We
illustrate our method and tools with an example
that implements security-improving transformations
on system architectures captured in the Architecture
Analysis and Design Language (AADL). We show how
input validation filter components can be synthesised
from regular expressions, and verified to meet arithmetic
constraints extracted from the AADL model. Such
filters comprise efficient guards on messages to/from
the autonomous system. The correctness proofs
for filters are automatically lifted to proofs of the
corresponding properties on the lazy streams that model
the communications of the generated seL4 threads.
Finally, we guarantee that the intent of the autonomy
application logic is accurately reflected in the application
binary code hosted on seL4 through the use of the verified
CakeML compiler.
