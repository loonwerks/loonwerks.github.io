<p>One of the important certification objectives for
airborne software is demonstrating the absence of unintended
behavior. In current software development processes, unintended
behavior is associated with some identifiable structural feature,
such as specific lines of code or a model element. However, in
learning-enabled systems (like neural networks or other machine
learning approaches), unintended behavior emerges from the data
used to train the system. New inputs not encountered during
training may result in novel activations in a neural network,
leading to unexpected (and potentially dangerous) outputs. In
this paper we will first review the rationale and methods for
detecting unintended behavior in current airborne software
systems, including the use of model based development techniques
and formal methods for software verification. Then we will
consider the challenges posed by learning-enabled components
(LECs) and examine new techniques that are being developed to
address these challenges, as well as how these techniques may
shape new certification guidance.
