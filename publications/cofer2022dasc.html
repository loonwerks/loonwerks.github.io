<p>Our team is developing assurance technologies that
can support the use of machine learning in the design of safety-critical
aircraft systems. These capabilities have been integrated
on Boeing's Autonomy Testbed Aircraft to show that they can
provide evidence of correct operation and safety guarantees
needed by real aircraft. We have applied run-time assurance
along with formal methods synthesis, modeling, and analysis
tools to an airborne collision avoidance system based on a neural
network. This system was demonstrated in flight and shown to
correctly monitor neural network operation and intervene when
needed to prevent violation of the "remain well clear" safety
requirement relative to an intruder aircraft.
