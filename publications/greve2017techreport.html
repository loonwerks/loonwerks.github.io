Model-based fuzzing is a fuzzing technique that employs a mathematical
model of system behavior to guide the fuzzing process and explore
behaviors that would otherwise be difficult to reach by chance.
Whereas traditional fuzzing frameworks generate tests randomly, a
model-based framework can deduce tests from a behavioral model using a
constraint solver.  We are developing FuzzM, a model-based fuzzing
framework that employs Lustre as a modeling language and leverages the
JKind model checker as a constraint solver.  Because the state space
being explored by the fuzzer is often large, the rapid generation of
test vectors is crucial.  The need to generate tests quickly, however,
is antithetical to the use of a constraint solver.  Our solution to
this problem is to use JKind to generate an initial solution and then
to perform trapezoidal generalization of the solution relative to the
Lustre specification.  Test generation then consists of rapid,
repeated, randomized sampling of trapezoidal generalization spaces.
Trapezoidal generalizations are ordered, hierarchical conjunctions of
linear constraints.  They are more expressive than simple intervals
but are more efficient to manipulate and easier to sample than generic
polytopes.  In this paper we describe an approach to the trapezoidal
generalizations of JKind counterexamples relative to Lustre models
with integer division, remainder, and uninterpreted functions.  We
demonstrate our approach on a Lustre specification that recognizes
permutations of complete integer sequences by generalizing a
counterexample sequence satisfying the permutation property to produce
a family of permuted sequences that can be rapidly sampled.
