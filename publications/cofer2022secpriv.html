<p>Formal methods tools that provide mathematical proof of system properties have
improved dramatically in their power and capabilities. Our team has developed a model-based
systems engineering environment that integrates formal methods at all levels of system design.
Our methodology and tools enable systems engineers to address cybersecurity concerns early
in the development of complex high-assurance systems.
