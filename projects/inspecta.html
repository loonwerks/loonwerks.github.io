<p>The goal of DARPA's Pipelined Reasoning of Verifiers Enabling Robust Systems (PROVERS) is to
develop formal methods tools fully integrated into pipelined software development and
maintenance processes to enable higher levels of assurance that software systems are free of
defects or security vulnerabilities. These formal methods tools will be designed for software
engineers in the defense and aerospace industries who are not formal methods experts.  Tooling will be
integrated into currently used software development pipelines, enabling a continuous flow of capabilities over time
while maintaining high assurance.</p>

<p>Collins Aerospace, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Kansas State University (KSU), University
of Kansas (KU), Proofcraft, University of New South Wales Sydney (UNSW), and DornerWorks
have teamed to address the challenges posed by the DARPA PROVERS program, which kicked off in March 2024. 
Our technical plan for INSPECTA is distinguished by the following characteristics:
<ol>
<li> Our workflow and tools will address the entire software development stack, from
requirements and system models to component source code, through build and
deployment on the seL4 secure microkernel, all linked by formal verification at each level. </li>
<li> We will achieve scalability for complex defense systems through compositional reasoning at
the system level and automated analysis of components based on powerful, cloud-based
solvers.</li>
<li> We will achieve the highest levels of assurance by building upon the best available
technologies and leveraging our experience from recent research programs as a starting
point.</li>
<li> Our tools will be integrated with current defense and aerospace workflow automation
processes and applied to mission critical products currently under development to
demonstrate their usability, practicality, and effectiveness.</li>
<li> Formal verification will be made accessible to non-formal methods experts through
automated analysis with streamlined user feedback and generalized proofs that are robust
to changes, allow for automated re-verification, and are augmented by automated repair
tools.</li>
<li> Our framework is adaptable and extendable to allow incorporation of results from other
researchers, including other specification languages, other source code languages, and
other operating system targets.</li>
<li> Our access to critical defense and aerospace products in both commercial and military
domains served by Collins will provide the basis for compelling demonstrations of INSPECTA
technologies.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tools being developed on the INSPECTA project are open-source and will be available on GitHub (stay tuned).
