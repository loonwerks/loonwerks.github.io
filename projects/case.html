<p>The goal of DARPA's Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program is to develop the
necessary design, analysis and verification tools to allow system engineers to design-in
cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do the other nonfunctional properties when
designing complex embedded computing systems. Cyber-resiliency means that the system
is tolerant to cyberattacks in the same way that safety-critical systems are tolerant to
random faults - they recover and continue to execute their mission function.</p>

<p>Collins Aerospace, Data61, and The University of Kansas have teamed to provide a
comprehensive solution to the Design Resiliency objectives for Technical Area 2 of the CASE program.
We are pursuing four technology development thrusts:
<ul>
<li>Verification of Cyber Requirements via formal architecture, design, and
implementation modeling/analysis, and automated information flow analysis</li>
<li>Cyber-Resilient Design Patterns via tool-assisted model transformations utilizing
verified cyber-resilient components</li>
<li>Runtime Assurance for Requirements via verified cyber-resilient components and
remote attestation</li>
<li>Architectural Design Model Validation via model-based test generation</li>
</ul></p>

<p>In CASE Technical Area 5, Collins Aerospace and our teammates, Data61, Adventium, and Kansas State University, will develop an integrated formal methods-based systems engineering tool
suite and work with military platform providers applying these tools to construct cyber-resilient
systems.  This effort will leverage our expertise in industrial application of formal methods,
development of complex military vehicles, formally verified operating system components,
and formal design languages and synthesis.</p>

<p>Tools developed on the CASE project are available on <a href="https://github.com/loonwerks/formal-methods-workbench" target="_blank">github</a>. AADL models based on an experimental UAV application are available <a href="https://github.com/loonwerks/case-ta6-experimental-platform-models" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<p>This video provides a demonstration of the BriefCASE tool environment that we have developed.  It shows how to use the tools to address multiple cyber-resiliency requirements for a UAV mission computing system.</p>

<p>In part two, we run the hardened UAV mission computing system built in the first video and test it against several cyber attacks to show the effectiveness of the approach.
