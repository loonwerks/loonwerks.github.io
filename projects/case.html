<p>The goal of DARPA's Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program is to develop the
necessary design, analysis and verification tools to allow system engineers to design-in
cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do the other nonfunctional properties when
designing complex embedded computing systems. Cyber-resiliency means that the system
is tolerant to cyberattacks in the same way that safety-critical systems are tolerant to
random faults - they recover and continue to execute their mission function.</p>

<p>Collins Aerospace, Adventium, the University of New South Wales (Sydney), the University of Kansas, 
and Kansas State University have teamed to provide a
comprehensive solution to the design resiliency and tool integration objectives 
of the CASE program.
We have developed a model-based
systems engineering environment called BriefCASE that
allows engineers to address a range of properties
and manage system complexity through compositional
analysis, integrating formal methods at
all levels of the design process.
Our tools are based on the Architecture Analysis
and Design Language (AADL) and extend
the Open Source AADL Tool Environment (OSATE).<\p>
	
<p>The main innovations of the BriefCASE tools
and methodology are:
<ol>
<li>We provide automated architectural design
patterns to address cyber-resiliency
requirements, including synthesis of highassurance
components from formal specifications.</li>
<li>Our MBSE environment can target different
operating systems including the seL4 microkernel,
making its formal security guarantees
easily accessible to developers. This
ensures that the implementation produced
is faithful to the modeled system.</li>
<li>Our approach is based upon co-evolution
of system design and assurance artifacts,
so that design changes automatically update
the associated certification evidence. An
assurance case is a structured argument,
supported by evidence, intended to justify
that a system is acceptably assured relative
to a concern (such as safety or security)
in the intended operating environment. An
assurance case is embedded in the architecture
model to capture and document the
design decisions along with associated rationale.</li>
<li>Formal methods are integrated throughout
the workflow, including requirements
capture, component synthesis, verification,
code generation, and the seL4 microkernel.</li>

<p>Tools developed on the CASE project are available on <a href="https://github.com/loonwerks/formal-methods-workbench" target="_blank">github</a>. AADL models based on an experimental UAV application are available <a href="https://github.com/loonwerks/case-ta6-experimental-platform-models" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<p>This video provides a demonstration of the BriefCASE tool environment that we have developed.  It shows how to use the tools to address multiple cyber-resiliency requirements for a UAV mission computing system.</p>

<p>In part two, we run the hardened UAV mission computing system built in the first video and test it against several cyber attacks to show the effectiveness of the approach.
